# JavaScript Algorithms

## Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements

### Description
Given two sets of elements, this algorithm finds the sum of all distinct elements from the sets.

### Usage
1. Open the JavaScript file `distinctSum.js`.
2. Modify the sets (`set1` and `set2`) as needed.
3. Run the script using a JavaScript environment (Node.js, browser console, etc.).
4. The result, the sum of distinct elements, will be displayed.

### Example
```javascript
let set1 = [3, 1, 7, 9];
let set2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3];
let output = sumOfDistinctElements(set1, set2);
console.log("Output:", output);
```

## Problem 2: Dot Product and Orthogonality Check

### Description
This algorithm calculates the dot product of vectors and checks orthogonality for pairs of vectors.

### Usage
1. Open the JavaScript file `dotProduct.js`.
2. Modify the vectors array as needed.
3. Run the script using a JavaScript environment (Node.js, browser console, etc.).
4. The result, whether vectors are orthogonal or not, will be displayed.

### Example
```javascript
let vectors = [
    [1, 0, 2],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [2, 0, 1]
];
checkOrthogonality(vectors);
```

### Notes
- The `dotProduct` function calculates the dot product of two vectors.
- The `checkOrthogonality` function checks orthogonality for all pairs of vectors.
